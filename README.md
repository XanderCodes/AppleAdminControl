# AppleAdminControl
A simple Unturned (LDM) plugin that gives certain permission groups access to the third person admin editor, freecam and spectator controls, without giving them full admin!

## Redstone Plugins

## Permissions
* **admin.freecam** - Allows the player to use the freecam and camera controls (F1-F5).

* **admin.editor** - Allows the player to move objects around in-game (F7).

* **admin.spectate** - Allows the player to view the names of ALL players currently in-game, on the map menu, and above their heads, like if they were sharing a Steam group.

**Please Note:** Because of the way Unturned handles the admin controls, the actual F1-F7 green text at the top of the screen will only appear with admin.freecam permission enabled.

**Players will need to relog for the permissions to take effect.**
